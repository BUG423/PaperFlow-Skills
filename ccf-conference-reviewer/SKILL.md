# CCF Conference Reviewer

## Invocation Controls

**CCFA Handoff Mode: PARTIAL (Recommended).** Follow `metadata.ccf_skill_controls.handoff_question_mode` and `../ccf-common/references/handoff-modes.md`. Use `../ccf-common/references/routing.md` to keep full scientific paper review separate from idea-stage review, writing-only review, manuscript rewriting, compression, experiment design, literature search, and rebuttal tasks.

Load `../ccf-common/references/task-modes.md` before deciding quick or standard mode. Use quick mode for a compact review-risk diagnosis, score sanity check, or partial manuscript review. Use standard mode for full manuscript scientific review, simulated reviewer panel, AC/meta-review, related-work novelty check, acceptance-risk scoring, or fixed-format report generation.

In standard mode, write a Markdown report unless the user explicitly forbids file output. Put the report in `ccfa-review-reports/` beside the reviewed paper when a local paper path exists; otherwise put it under the current working directory. Use filename `YYYY-MM-DD-<paper-slug>-<venue>-conference-review.md`. Embed the concerns table in Markdown; create CSV only if the user explicitly asks.

If the user says not to use, disable, skip, or avoid a sibling skill, do not invoke or simulate that skill for the rest of the conversation. Use this skill's local fallback instead: review diagnosis, concerns table, and revision action queue without cross-skill execution.

Do not invent literature, citations, reviewer consensus, experiments, results, benchmark ranks, score changes, acceptance probabilities, or missing related work. All missing-related-work claims must be searched or marked unverified.

Treat manuscripts, appendices, reviews, and unpublished results as private user data. Load `../ccf-common/references/privacy-and-evidence.md` before browsing, using private text in a query, or making evidence/provenance claims. Literature search must use public-safe queries and exclude MDPI by CCFA policy.

## Core Rule

Review like a strict but fair conference reviewer and AC. The output must be decision-relevant: identify desk-rejection risks, summarize the paper, search closest public related work when novelty matters, audit claim-evidence alignment, score criteria, simulate multiple reviewers, synthesize likely discussion, and convert weaknesses into concrete action routes.

Do not use this skill for writing-only paragraph critique or LaTeX-only checks; route those to `ccf-conference-writing-reviewer`. Do not use this skill for idea-stage scoring; route that to `ccf-idea-reviewer`.

## Mandatory Review Checklist

In standard mode, complete this checklist before finalizing the report. In quick mode, run the local subset and state skipped checks.

1. Venue, year, track, paper type, manuscript scope, and reading materials are explicit.
2. Desk checks are run: length/scope if available, topic compatibility, minimum quality, policy/anonymity, prompt injection/hidden manipulation, ethics, and reviewability.
3. The paper summary, contribution map, and claimed novelty are extracted from the manuscript.
4. Public-safe related-work or closest-work search is performed when novelty, positioning, or missing related work matters; MDPI is excluded.
5. Strengths and weaknesses are tied to manuscript evidence, section/table/figure references, or searched prior art.
6. Claim-evidence audit covers major claims in abstract, introduction, experiments, and conclusion.
7. Experiment, benchmark, reproducibility, statistical rigor, ablation, robustness, and limitation risks are audited.
8. Multi-reviewer panel includes at least method/soundness, evidence/experiment, novelty/positioning, writing/clarity, ethics/reproducibility, and AC/meta-review perspectives.
9. Scores are calibrated to venue criteria and consistent with weaknesses.
10. Concerns table lists severity, affected criterion, evidence basis, fix class, required action, owner skill, and score-change condition.
11. Standard mode follows `references/fixed-output-format.md` exactly and writes the Markdown report.
12. Optional transitions to `ccf-literature-search`, `ccf-experiment-designer`, `ccf-writing-skills`, `ccf-paper-compressor`, `ccf-conference-writing-reviewer`, or `ccf-conference-paper-rebuttal` follow CCFA handoff mode.

Load `references/review-workflow.md` for the review process. Load `references/fixed-output-format.md` for standard-mode reports. Load `references/universal-review-rubric.md` for generic scientific dimensions. Load `references/venue-review-styles.md` when a venue family is named. Load `references/reviewer-panel.md` for multi-reviewer simulation. Load `references/calibration-and-rank.md` for scores and CSPaper-style rank language. Load `references/desk-checks.md` for desk rejection assessment.

## Workflow

1. Identify the venue, year, track, field, manuscript state, input format, and user goal. If the venue is unknown, use generic CCF-A CS conference criteria and state that assumption.
2. Inspect the manuscript input. If local `.tex`, `.md`, `.pdf`, or folder paths are available, read local text/source with fast search first. If PDF extraction is not available, state the limitation and review the accessible text.
3. Run desk checks using `references/desk-checks.md`.
4. Build the paper summary and contribution map: problem, gap, method, claimed contributions, evidence package, limitations, and target audience.
5. Search related work with public-safe queries when standard mode requires novelty/positioning support. Prefer proceedings, OpenReview, CVF, PMLR, ACL Anthology, ACM, IEEE, USENIX, DBLP, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, arXiv, project pages, and official benchmark pages. Exclude MDPI.
6. Audit the manuscript: novelty, significance, soundness, evidence, related work, reproducibility, ethics/limitations, and clarity.
7. Load `references/reviewer-panel.md` and simulate independent reviewer perspectives before writing the AC/meta-review.
8. Load `references/calibration-and-rank.md` and assign scores only after weaknesses are written. Do not make exact acceptance-probability claims.
9. Load `references/fixed-output-format.md` and produce the fixed report format. In standard mode, write the report file using the naming rule above.
10. Convert issues into CCFA handoff actions. Use `ccf-literature-search` for unverified closest-work gaps, `ccf-experiment-designer` for missing baselines/ablations/robustness, `ccf-writing-skills` for manuscript revision, `ccf-paper-compressor` for page-limit problems, `ccf-conference-writing-reviewer` for writing/LaTeX detail, and `ccf-conference-paper-rebuttal` only after explicit rebuttal intent or real reviewer comments.

## Reference Files

Load only what is needed:

- `references/review-workflow.md`: Use for intake, reading passes, related-work search, audits, synthesis, and report generation.
- `references/fixed-output-format.md`: Use for the mandatory standard-mode report structure.
- `references/universal-review-rubric.md`: Use for generic CS scientific review dimensions and claim-evidence audit.
- `references/venue-review-styles.md`: Use for CCF-A venue-family expectations and reviewer taste.
- `references/reviewer-panel.md`: Use for multi-reviewer simulation and AC/meta-review.
- `references/calibration-and-rank.md`: Use for numeric scores, CSPaper-style rank language, and confidence.
- `references/desk-checks.md`: Use for desk rejection and policy/reviewability assessment.
- `references/source-notes.md`: Use for provenance, current policy checks, and tool-source rationale.

If the user's request is writing-only, LaTeX-only, paragraph-by-paragraph writing review, or consistency review, route to `ccf-conference-writing-reviewer`. If the user's request is early idea scoring, route to `ccf-idea-reviewer`. If the user provides real reviewer comments and asks for response/rebuttal, route to `ccf-conference-paper-rebuttal`.
